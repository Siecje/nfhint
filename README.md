# NFHint

**Non-fiction hint**. A linter for English non-fiction. Inspired by [JSHint](http://jshint.com/), (On Writing Well)[http://www.amazon.ca/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0060891548], and (The Elements of Style)[http://www.amazon.com/The-Elements-Style-Fourth-Edition/dp/020530902X].

### Usage

Right now, this is just a few maps to help you avoid using clotted language. In the future, this will be a proper linter, much like JSHint.
